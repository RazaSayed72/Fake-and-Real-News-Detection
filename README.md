# Fake-and-Real-News-Detection
This project aims to classify news articles as Real or Fake using a dataset of true and false news. It involves data preparation, feature extraction (TF-IDF, word2vec), and building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for classification. Model performance will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
